python solution for 8 qweens challenge..

#The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard 
#so that no two queens threaten each other; 
#thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal
# 
# so the solution may go like this;
# 1;  first we need to modify our chess board by list
# 2;  than we need a loop that append to the list our "queens" 
#   the loop goes that the first "queen" placed in the first square 
#   than she go through the list and check if its possible to place the "qween" there
# 3;  the checks need to be done by go through all the list and check if there is "quween" in the same row,
#   column, or diagonal if there isn't so the "quween" is placed until 8 times;
# 4;  it's done by three major funcs 1)check_threats_line()
#                                    2)check_threats_column()
#    till the end ..happy end!!
